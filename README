Ticketee App
============

This Ruby on Rails application is a project management application. Users can create 
tickets for projects in order to have a guide of the projects. These projects are 
managed by administrators.

This complete application is the example of the eight first chapters of the book 
Rails 3 in Action written by Ryan Bigg and Yehuda Katz. It is developed using BDD 
(Behaviour Driven Development) which is a technique to create applications using 
tests from the begining. I really recommend this text to start with BDD.

I just have added some html and css stylesheets to the example.
